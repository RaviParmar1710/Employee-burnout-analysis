# Employee-burnout-analysis

This project focuses on analyzing employee burnout using a dataset provided by the Edunet Foundation as part of an internship program in collaboration with the IBM SkillsBuild initiative. The objective is to identify key factors influencing burnout and evaluate their impact through data analysis and machine learning techniques.

The analysis involves cleaning and preprocessing the data, exploring correlations, and building a linear regression model to predict burnout rates. Insights gained from this project aim to help organizations better understand burnout trends and take proactive measures to support employee well-being.

Features:
Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover meaningful insights.
Feature correlation analysis to identify impactful factors.
Machine learning model (Linear Regression) to predict burnout rates.
Visualizations to represent insights effectively.
Tools and Libraries Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
Google Colab for development and execution
Dataset:
The dataset was sourced from the Edunet Foundation internship program.
